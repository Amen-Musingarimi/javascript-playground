// Primitive JavaScript Data Types Notes
// In JavaSript there are 5 different data types which are:
// 1. Number - Floating point numbers, for decimals and intergers
// 2. String - Sequence characters, used for text
// 3. Boolean - Logical data type that can only be true/false
// 4. Undefined - Data type of a variable that does not have a value yet
// 5. Null - Also means non-existent

// let, const and var
// let defines variables that can be mutated. e.g years of a person which are always changing each year
// const defines variables which can not be mutated, e.g date of birth which can never change
// var is similar to let but differ their perfomance behind the scenes,
